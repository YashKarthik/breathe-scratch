# Breathe

An alert system to warn you when the pollution level in your city (or region) reaches dangerous levels. Currently work in progress.

## General Idea
- You get email, SMS, WhatsApp (other apps maybe) notifications for pollution levels in the city you choose.
- Why? I just moved to a polluted city and I think I'll actually use this.
